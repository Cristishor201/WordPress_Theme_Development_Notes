In case of using `Local WP` (Local by Flywheel), the root folder it will be in `Cristian (username)/Local Sites/(project name)/app/public/wp-content/themes`

Here just create a new folder, and this will be considered a new theme.
Just add this minimal files:
- `index.php`
- `style.css`

In the `style.css` add this on the begining of the file:

```
